## [01. Titanic 데이터 분석]
***[Challenge]***

use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

***[Description]***

On April 15, 1912, during voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: `"what sorts of people were more likely to survive?”` using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

 ## [02. California Housing Prices]
  The data pertains to the houses found in a given California district and some summary stats about them based on the 1990 census data. Be warned the data aren't cleaned so there are some preprocessing steps required! The columns are as follows, their names are pretty self explanitory:
